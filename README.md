# lovesong

I've been listening to [a really fun mix](https://www.mixcloud.com/jamonitproductions/zack-hill-live-at-relove-x-slinky-062616/) which features a fun version of The Cure's Lovesong (at around 50m10s). Having listened to it more than several times over a few days, I had the idea that it could be constructed pretty easily with a script. So, bored today, I threw these together.
